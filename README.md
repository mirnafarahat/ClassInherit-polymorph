This C++ program demonstrates the use of inheritance and class hierarchy to calculate the area, surface area, and volume of a rectangle and a box. The code defines a base class Rectangle with a constructor to initialize the length and width attributes. The Rectangle class includes a method to compute the area of the rectangle.

The derived class Box inherits from the Rectangle class and introduces a new attribute, depth, to represent the third dimension of the box. The Box class includes a constructor to initialize all dimensions and overrides the area method to calculate the surface area of the box. Additionally, the Box class introduces a method to calculate the volume of the box.

In the main function, instances of both the Rectangle and Box classes are created. The program calculates and displays the area of the rectangle, the surface area of the box, and the volume of the box using the appropriate methods from the respective classes.

This code illustrates the principles of inheritance and method overriding in object-oriented programming using C++. It showcases how a derived class can extend and modify the behavior of a base class, resulting in a hierarchy of related classes with varying functionality.
